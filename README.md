## 📘 Abstract

The **Enhanced Rail-Fence Cipher (ERFC)** is a modern encryption scheme that merges classical transposition with emoji-based substitution, aiming to bridge security with human-centered design. ERFC is built on the classical Rail Fence Cipher, enhanced with key-based emoji substitution, randomized matrix transposition, and integrity hashing via SHA-256. It is especially useful for educational, lightweight secure messaging, and cryptographic puzzles.

## 🧠 Architecture Overview

ERFC is based on four main layers of transformation:

1. **Substitution Layer**  
   Each character is mapped to a unique emoji using a deterministic key-based hash. This hides textual patterns and adds visual obfuscation.

2. **Grid-based Matrix Transposition**  
   The emoji-encoded message is inserted into a 2D matrix following a spiral or random walk pattern determined by a hashed key.

3. **Salt & Length Encryption**  
   The message length is encrypted and padded with salt to disguise size and improve resistance to pattern matching.

4. **SHA-256 Integrity Hash**  
   The ciphertext is shipped with a hash of the plaintext for authenticity and tamper detection.

## 🔐 How ERFC Works

The encryption process involves several transformations:

### 🔄 Substitution Mapping
Each alphanumeric character is replaced with a unique emoji. The key is hashed and determines the emoji permutation used.

### 🔳 Matrix Construction
The emoji string is placed into a 2D matrix (grid) using a randomized spiral pattern, improving diffusion and hiding order.

### 🧂 Salt Generation
Salt is added to the encrypted string, and the original message length is encrypted using the key to prevent size leakage.

### 🧬 SHA-256 Hashing
The SHA-256 hash of the original plaintext is stored to verify the message on decryption.

## 🔏 Encryption Process

```python
from src.erfc import encrypt

plaintext = "MyPassword123"
key = "SecretKey"
ciphertext, integrity_hash = encrypt(plaintext, key)
```

**Result**:
- `ciphertext`: Encrypted emoji sequence.
- `integrity_hash`: SHA-256 hash of the original message.

---

## 🔓 Decryption Process

```python
from src.erfc import decrypt

decrypted = decrypt(ciphertext, key, integrity_hash)
assert decrypted == plaintext
```

On mismatch, the function raises an error or warning indicating integrity failure.

## 🔐 Security Analysis

ERFC was evaluated using standard cryptographic principles:

- **Confusion & Diffusion:** Achieved via emoji substitution and matrix transposition.
- **Avalanche Effect:** Small input changes cause widespread output differences.
- **Brute-Force Resistance:** Keyed substitution and random placement yield high entropy.
- **Frequency Analysis Defense:** Emoji layer destroys alphabetic patterns.

> See [Section VI: Security Analysis](docs/ERFC_paper.pdf) for in-depth analysis and math.

## ⚡ Performance & Efficiency

- Time complexity is O(n) for substitution and matrix insertion.
- Memory use is linear with message size.
- Efficient enough for short messages and emojis across platforms.

---

## 📦 Applications

- 🔐 Secure casual messaging (especially emoji-supported platforms)
- 🎮 Puzzle-based CTF (Capture The Flag) competitions
- 📚 Teaching cryptographic concepts interactively
- 🎨 Creating secret emoji art or encoding for games

## 💾 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/akamohid/Enhanced-Rail-fence-Cipher.git

cd ERFC
python src/erfc.py
```

Optional:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

No additional dependencies required – works with Python 3.8+.
